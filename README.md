# Apps recommendation system 

This is the code for the apps recommendation system . <br/>
The app is composed of a server written in node.js & express and a client written in react.
I used Material UI.

## How to start?
* Clone the project.
* In the project directory, run "npm i" to install all required node modules on the server side.
* cd into the client directory, run "npm i" to install all required node modules on the client side..


## How to run the project?
* In the project directory, run:
### `npm start 
to start the server on port 5000.
* cd into the client directory, run:
### `npm start 
to start the client on http://localhost:3000.
